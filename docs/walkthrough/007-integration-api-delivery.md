# Walkthrough — Spec 007: Integration, API, and Documentation Completion

This page is the operator-facing summary of [Spec 007](../../specs/007-integration-api-delivery/spec.md). It documents the API package's first non-stub release, the public-surface manifest that downstream operators pin against, the four integration-mode examples under `examples/`, and the consolidated doc tree under `docs/architecture/`.

## What changed

Five deliverables, all additive:

| Deliverable | Where |
|---|---|
| `arc-guard-service` (the `packages/api/` package) gains its first non-stub release with an in-process `run_guard()` adapter, a `python -m arc_guard_service` CLI, and a single-endpoint `POST /v1/guard` HTTP transport under the `[fastapi]` extra | [`packages/api/src/arc_guard_service/`](../../packages/api/src/arc_guard_service/) |
| Public-surface manifest enumerating every Stable / Provisional / Experimental / Internal symbol across the three packages, with a CI drift check (`tools/check_public_surface.py`) | [`docs/public-surface.md`](../public-surface.md) |
| Four self-contained integration examples (library / sidecar HTTP / CLI batch / FastAPI middleware), each with a smoke test | [`examples/`](../../examples/) |
| Walkthroughs refreshed to a uniform 5-section schema; new entry for Spec 007 | [`docs/walkthrough/`](.) |
| Architecture index consolidating cross-cutting references | [`docs/architecture/`](../architecture/) |

The decision contract from Specs 002–006 is **frozen**. Spec 007 ships exactly two new public types: `RefusalCode.API_TRANSPORT_TIMEOUT` (one new enum member) and `TransportError(PipelineError)` (one new exception leaf with a matching `FAIL_RULE` row).

## Why

Without Spec 007, the rewrite ships as five packages of contracts that can only be consumed from Python. The "one contract many modes" constitution principle requires at least the SDK + sidecar + CLI + middleware modes to demonstrably share `GuardPipeline.pre_process` semantics. Spec 007 makes that real: an operator can pick any of the four examples, follow the README, and have a working integration in under 15 minutes regardless of their host language.

The public-surface manifest exists because pre-1.0 packages otherwise leak implicit-stability promises through `__all__` lists. The manifest makes the contract explicit: pin to Stable, evaluate Provisional, accept change risk on Experimental, and never depend on Internal-importable.

## Public surface

| Symbol | Package | Kind | Band | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `run_guard` | `arc_guard_service` | function | Provisional | sync adapter for `GuardPipeline.pre_process` |
| `ServiceSettings` | `arc_guard_service` | class | Provisional | transport-layer config (bind / port / max_request_bytes / request_timeout_seconds / pipeline_factory) |
| `create_app` | `arc_guard_service.transport.http` | function | Provisional | FastAPI factory; lazy-imports `fastapi` |
| `RefusalCode.API_TRANSPORT_TIMEOUT` | `arc_guard_core` | enum_member | Provisional | sibling of `API_INVALID_REQUEST`; emitted by transport-layer timeouts |
| `TransportError` | `arc_guard_core` | class | Provisional | leaf exception (`__failure_mode__='closed'`); transport-layer failures |
| `FAILURE_API_TRANSPORT` | `arc_guard_core` | constant | Provisional | failure-class label string |

The full manifest (140+ entries across the three packages) lives at [`docs/public-surface.md`](../public-surface.md). The CI surface-drift check verifies this list matches `__all__` at runtime; adding a new public name without updating the manifest fails CI.

## Operator knobs

The HTTP transport is configurable via `ServiceSettings`:

| Field | Default | Env var |
|---|---|---|
| `bind` | `127.0.0.1` | `ARC_GUARD_SERVICE_BIND` |
| `port` | `8000` | `ARC_GUARD_SERVICE_PORT` |
| `max_request_bytes` | `65536` (64 KiB) | `ARC_GUARD_SERVICE_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` |
| `request_timeout_seconds` | `30.0` | `ARC_GUARD_SERVICE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` |
| `pipeline_factory` | `None` (default `GuardPipeline()`) | `ARC_GUARD_SERVICE_PIPELINE_FACTORY` |
| `log_level` | `INFO` | `ARC_GUARD_SERVICE_LOG_LEVEL` |

Set `pipeline_factory` to a dotted path like `myproject.guard:build_pipeline` to use a custom-configured pipeline (e.g., one with the `[semantic]` extra wired up).
